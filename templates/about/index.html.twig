            Welcome to <span class="highlight">Symfony Shop</span> — your trusted online destination for high-quality and stylish shoes for every step of life.

        <img class="about-img" src="{{ asset('images/about_banner.jpg') }}" alt="About Symfony Shop">

        <h2 class="about-subtitle">Where It All Began</h2>
        <p>
            Symfony Shop started as a small idea in a university dorm, where a group of tech-obsessed friends realized that the online shoe shopping experience was outdated, clunky, and uninspiring.
            With a background in software development and a shared love for sneakers, they launched Symfony Shop — a fast, responsive, and customer-focused platform built entirely with Symfony and passion.
        </p>

        <h2 class="about-subtitle">Our Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
            We believe shoes are more than just accessories — they are a statement, a necessity, and a story.
            That's why our collection ranges from classic everyday sneakers to performance shoes and unique limited-edition drops.
            At Symfony Shop, quality, comfort, and design walk hand in hand.
        </p>
